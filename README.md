# Suicide Rates Around The World A Study

### Our project aims to comprehensively analyze global suicide trends, with over 1 million annual deaths, occurring approximately every 40 seconds. We focus on prevention through evidence-based strategies, targeting communities, sub-populations, and individuals. Our dataset encompasses suicide data across 101 countries, containing 27,821 entries featuring information like country, gender, age, suicides, population, GDP, and generation. Employing Jupyter and Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we extract pertinent features for addressing key questions. The subsequent step involves crafting a Tableau dashboard for impactful data visualization, facilitating solutions to business queries.
